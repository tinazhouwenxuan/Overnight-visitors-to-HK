                                The tourism industry is one of the four pillars of the economy of Hong Kong. It took about five percentage of Hong Kong’s gross domestic product (GDP) from 2013 to 2015, but the percentage share contributed by the tourism industry started to decrease in 2016, and it reduced to 4.5 percent in 2017, according to the <a href="https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/sp80.jsp?tableID=189&ID=0&productType=8" class="storybody_link">Census and Statistics Department</a> of the government of Hong Kong.

                                    <strong>The per capita spending of overnight visitors to Hong Kong all slipped</strong> to a lower level in 2017 compared with the values in 2011. The per capita spending of overnight visitors from North Asia declined most by nearly 22.2 percent from HK$5,113 in 2011 to HK$3,978 in 2017.

                                    <strong>Overnight visitors from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East stayed in Hong Kong for the longest time</strong> when travelling in Hong Kong, with the average of 4.1 nights. Visitors from Macao stayed in Hong Kong for the shortest time with the average of 2.2 nights. Mainland Chinese visitors became to stay shorter and shorter in Hong Kong, from the average of 3.9 nights in 2011 to 3.1 nights in 2017.

                                    <strong>Overnight visitors from mainland China always had the highest value of per capita spending</strong> during these years, with the average value of HK$8,091. In 2013, mainland Chinese visitors set a record of the highest value of per capita spending when traveling in Hong Kong, which amounted to HK$8,937.

                                    <strong>Staying in Hong Kong longer does not exactly mean spending more.</strong> For instance, overnight visitors from South and Southeast Asia, their average length of stay gradually increased from 3.2 nights in 2011 to 3.5 nights in 2017, while the highest value of per capita spending was HK$6,735 in 2014 when the average length of stay was 3.4 nights. Overnight visitors from Taiwan are also in accord with this consumer pattern. Their length of stay in Hong Kong increased during these years, while their per capita spending went down from HK$5,860 in 2011 to HK$4,758 in 2017.
